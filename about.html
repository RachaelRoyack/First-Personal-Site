        <p id="zoo">Whenever I have the opportunity to visit a Zoo or a Safari I never miss it. 
            The San Diego Zoo has become one of the most amazing places in the world to me.
            If you've never been and are an animal lover you should definitly add it to your bucket list!
        </p>
        <p>Animals are my happy place. They provide more joy, peace, and serenity than anything else in 
            the world.</p>

        <p>Running is, handsdown, my absolute favorite form of exercise. I'm addicted to that 
            <q>Runner's High</q> that makes you feel like you're on top of the world. Running is also 
            the <strong>safest</strong> form of exercise for me inparticular due to my lack of coordination. &#129315;</p>
